The city of Branson, Missouri, where Rose O’Neill retired in, holds a “Kewpiesta” every year to commemorate the icon that is the Kewpie character. There is also the Bonniebrook Homestead in Missouri. The Bonniebrook Homestead is a museum dedicated to Rose O’Neill’s famous life and legacy. The museum holds Kewpie collectibles such as dolls, comic strips of the original illustrations, dishes, and more on display.<br>

        With the changing of time throughout history, Kewpie dolls have been undergoing many changes and iterations.
