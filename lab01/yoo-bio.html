        My name is Hyejun Yoo!

        I am an Advertising and Information Management & Technology major interested in learning about how data analytics affect market research and consumer behaviors.
        
        I am very organized and thorough in all my efforts. Recently I have participated in various programs such as the 4Aâ€™s MAIP 2021 Fellowship.
        
        I am a big movie person and I enjoy listening to music, hanging out with my friends, and going to concerts! I try to have a fun word of the week every week and I also love curating collectible items.
        
        I look forward to all my future endeavors and hope to value my morals in whatever I do in the future!
